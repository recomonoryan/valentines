					<h3>Dear Anriette, </h3>
					<p>
						A famous person once said, <i>"Everyone says 'love hurts' but that is not true. Lonelineness hurts. Rejection hurts. Losing someone hurts. Envy hurts. Everyone gets these things confused with love, but in reality love is the only thing in this world that covers up all pain and makes someone feel wonderful again. Love is the only thing in this world that does not hurt."</i><br><br>I find the sentiment to be reassuring. Too many people had loved and gotten hurt in the process that we so often forget that love is the best thing we do. Love is what brought us into this world for there are no accidents and love is the last thing we are going to be doing as we draw our last breath. Love is the power that can give a weak person the strength to stand up, give happiness to those who need it, and ultimately, give the very purpose of life.<br><br>
						I won't pretend that I know what you have been through, but you are one of the strongest women I ever have the privilege of knowing. You had been hurt, knocked down, and through struggles that would just make anybody snap and give up on everything, but you stood your ground and that is because of love. It is the love that not only you gave, but felt through the many people who had stood by your side, helped picked you up, dusted your shoulders, and gave you the courage to keep on going. Look at you now: A woman with a good career and living life with the people she cares for and cares for her too. Most importantly, you are a mother who is willing to sacrifice anything to give her child a life he deserves. Truly, there is no greater love than the love given by a parent to his/her child. You have achieved and did this all out of love. So this Valentines Day, never forget to remind yourself that you are not alone, that you are loved by genuine people, and to give love to those who need it. <br> <br>

						TO THE MOST BEAUTIFUL, KIND, AND WONDERFUL WOMAN, HAPPY VALENTINES DAY ANRIETTE!<br><br>
					</p>

						With love, <br>
